# Incinerate-Protocol
Incinerate(FIRE) is a fork of of the token SafeMoon with burning tokenomics.

To decrease the supply of Incinerate, we apply 3 simple functions: Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn-In each trade.

The transaction is taxed a 10% fee, which is split 2 ways.

  6% fee = redistributed to all existing holders including a burn wallet.
  4% fee is split 50/50 half of which is sold by the contract into BCH, while the other half of the FIRE tokens are paired automatically with the previously mentioned BCH and added as a liquidity pair on MistSwap.‚Äù


Max swap is 500,000,000 FIRE both ways which is ~2,38% of starting supply.

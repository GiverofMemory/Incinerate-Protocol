Incinerate(FIRE![SMALLFIRENUMBER1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93559093/140784416-9abf8f37-2db0-4ce3-8f9b-c11f86bc8efb.png)) is a fork of of the token SafeMoon with burning tokenomics.

To decrease the supply of Incinerate, we apply 3 simple functions: Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn-In each trade.

The transaction is taxed a 10% fee, which is split 2 ways.

  6% fee is redistributed to all existing holders including a burn wallet.
  
  4% fee is split 50/50 half of which is sold by the contract into BCH, while the other half of the FIRE tokens are paired automatically with the previously mentioned BCH and added as a liquidity pair on MistSwap.

Maximum supply is 21.000.000.000(21bln)
Max FIRE transfered every buy is 500,000,000 which is ~2,38% of starting supply.

 Developer and Marketing wallet will not receive any fees from transactions.
